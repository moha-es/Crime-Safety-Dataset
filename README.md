# 🕵️ Crime & Safety Dataset Analysis (SQL Project)

This project explores a dataset of 1,000 real crime reports collected over two years in an urban area.  
Each record contains the crime type, time, location, and victim demographics such as age, gender, and race.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns related to demographics, crime frequency, and locations using SQL.
